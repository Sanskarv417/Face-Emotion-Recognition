# Face-Emotion-Recognition

### The project had been created under CS-354N Computer Science Course, under the supervision of Dr. Aruna Tiwari. The team members are - Khushi Verma (200001036) and Sanskar Verma (200001069).

## The steps to completely build our model from scratch including the data preprocessing, training, and testing are:
1. Download the Face-Emotion-Recognition.ipynb file.
2. Create a virtual environment of tensorflow in python 3.10.
3. Activate the environment and simply run all the cells sequentially.

## If you wish to use our saved model files for direct realtime-prediction:
1. Download the Face-Emotion-Realtime-Detection.ipynb file.
2. Activate a virtual environment containing tensorflow in python 3.10.
3. Run all the cells sequentially. A windows camera capture pop-up will apear and give realtime predictions on the live input video.

**The details of our model and project can be found in the 'Final Report.pdf'** uploaded in the github repository.

Thank you.
